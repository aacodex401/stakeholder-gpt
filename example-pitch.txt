# Q2 Roadmap: AI-Powered Search

## Problem
Users spend 3+ minutes finding products on our platform. Search abandonment rate is 40%, directly impacting conversion.

## Solution
Implement semantic search powered by vector embeddings with AI-driven product recommendations. Users describe what they want in natural language, and the system understands intent—not just keywords.

## Timeline
- Month 1: Vector database integration (Pinecone), index existing catalog
- Month 2: ML model training on user behavior and purchase history
- Month 3: A/B test against current search, gradual rollout

## Resources Required
- 2 backend engineers (full-time)
- 1 ML engineer (full-time)
- $15k/month infrastructure costs (vector DB + compute)

## Expected Impact
- 50% reduction in average search time
- 20% increase in search-to-purchase conversion
- $2M additional annual revenue (based on current traffic × improved conversion)

## Risks & Mitigations
- ML model accuracy: Starting with hybrid approach (semantic + keyword fallback)
- Infrastructure costs: Will optimize after proving value in A/B test
- Team capacity: Delaying Q2 analytics dashboard to free up resources
